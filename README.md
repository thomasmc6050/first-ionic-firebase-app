## My Event Manager

This is the companion source code for the Event Manager guide, all you need to do is navigate to the folder where you have this downloaded and run `npm install`.

For example, if it's in the development folder, you'll do this:

```bash
$ cd development
$ npm install
$ ionic serve
```
